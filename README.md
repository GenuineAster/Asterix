Asterix
========

Asterix is a bootloader, kernel, and OS project written in Assembly, C++, and C.
Asterix was written by Mischa 'Aster' Alff for educational purposes, to learn about Assembly and OS development in general.

To build Asterix, just run
```bash
$ make
```

To run Asterix, you'll need QEMU, Bochs, or any x86-compatible emulator.
Example:
```bash
$ make
$ qemu asterix.iso
```
That's all, folks!
